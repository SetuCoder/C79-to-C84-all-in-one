# Barter-App-9

Continuation for the Barter App 2 prolly, lol I missed adding repos to the projects from C79 to C84 as I had some (heck a ton) problems running the output whlist I completed the code for each of them. Now the app is near complete, I'll release the .apk once the app is totally done. And also if you really wanna see how the app is now, try running the app on a snack editor, [click me for the link](https://snack.expo.io/@setucoder/c79-to-c84-all-in-one-projects). Try running the app on your mobile as the web version shows some errors. You can open a issue in this repo anytime for help.
